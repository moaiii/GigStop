Django Web App for browsing local events through the YouTube Wall/ Band promtionals
Currently not live due to pythonanywhere account expiration

A university project built in Django which enables bands to upload their promotional videos to a public 'wall', 
users can quickly browse through bands media content which is organised by location of show date and location to them. The bands media content is related to an upcoming show they have. This differs from the traditional approach of looking up a text based list. It encourages the exploration of live local music. 

Built in Python and the Django web framework with some javascript, Ajax, CSS and HTML

University Grade - A
